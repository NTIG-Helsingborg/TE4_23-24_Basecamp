## Streamlined Learning Paths

One of our primary goals is to centralize all necessary materials for the courses in one place, presented in a structured manner.

By doing so, we aim to enhance productivity, ultimately leading to better results for every learner.

## Server Setup

To start, download [php](https://windows.php.net/download/) (choose VS16 x64 Thread Safe Zip option) and extract. Then, install the "phpserver" extension in VSCode.

In VSCode, press `CTRL + ,` and search for `phpserver:php config path`. Set the config path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\php\php.ini-development`).

Edit the `php.ini-development` file: remove `;` from lines with `;extension_dir = "ext"`, `;extension=pdo_sqlite`, and `;extension=sqlite3`.

Finally, change "PHP Path" to your PHP executable path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\php\php.exe`). Now, go to `index.php`, right-click, and select "PHP Server: Serve Project."
